testimonial = "Wallstreet Realty is a one-stop place if you want to sell your home and buy another.  A good friend of mine bought a home 10 years ago at a good price.  When it came time to sell she asked for my advice. I sent her to Wallstreet Realty. John, the owner/ broker listed her home, advised her to hold off for the right price and helped her find her current home. He also connected her with a great loan officer to help her get the best rates to get into her new home. This is the third client I send to John and I can't recommend anyone else but him.  The guy is just an honest and hardworking broker. You can't go wrong with Wallstreet Realty so I recommend them."

testimonial = "We had a great experience selling our home thanks to John and his team of professionals. When we first met with John, he had prepared a Home Evaluation complete with a Comparative Market Analysis for our use. He explained the various closing costs associated with selling our home and he answered any questions we had. He gave us some tips on what we could do to improve the outside appearance of our home, which is what prospective buyers see first. We were pleasantly surprised at how fast our home sold and that we got top dollar for it! We found John and his staff to be very professional and we would not hesitate to do business with him in the future."
